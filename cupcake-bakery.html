        <h2>Adventure Time!</h2>
        <p>I love the art and feel of animation- this is a witty show about a human boy named Finn and, Jake, his magic dog. They explore the land of Ooo and have some incredible adventures. It's one of my favority things to watch- it keeps the mind amused and the mood light. <a href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/adventuretime/">Adventure Time</a>!</p>

        <p>I'm always up for a match- or for watching one- and there's nothing better than strumming when you're not coding.</p>

        <h2>Now, a bit about me:</h2>
        <p>I began my professional life as a Recovery Counselor working with adolescents. I discovered how much I liked working with students and planned a basic computer class to help make the transition into moving into the working world after high school. After learning a bit of code, I was hooked. I was a counselor by day and a developing coder by night. Then I discovered Dev Bootcamp. The rest is, as they say, history.</p>
